
I have created a simple Web API call for all the actions For petting an animal

The requirments are 
•	Petting animals makes them happy
•	Feeing animals makes them less hungry
•	Animals start "neutral" on both metrics
•	Happiness decreases over time / hunger increases over time
•	Users can own multiple animals of different types
•	Different animal types have metrics which increase/decrease at different rates

All the above features are on the home page only

On top banner last fetaure is displayed user has different animals and has different metrics

Rest of the three features are displayed below banner in three blocks

Please have a look and give a try
